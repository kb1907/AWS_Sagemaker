- In this folder, different scale Machine Learning / Deep Learning / NLP projects by using AWS Sagemaker can be found.
- All the projects were done by using real life data.
- This folder will be updated constantly.
- All the best ðŸ¤˜

### AWS Sagemaker Projects

1. [AWS Sagemaker - Object Detection](https://github.com/kb1907/AWS_Sagemaker/blob/main/AWS_Sagemaker_Object_Detection/Sagemaker%20Object%20Detection%20-%20Learner%20Notebook.ipynb)

- In this project I used AWS - Sagemaker for the object detection job. 

2. [AWS Sagemaker - House Prediction](https://github.com/kb1907/AWS_Sagemaker/blob/main/AWS_Sagemaker_House_Prediction/AWSSagemaker_House_Prediction.ipynb)

- In this project, I used classical house prediction data to show two different usage of AWS- Sagemaker (with Python SDK & with Boto3)

3. [BOTO3](https://github.com/kb1907/AWS_Sagemaker/blob/main/AWS_boto3/boto3_read_S3.ipynb)

- In this project I made a gentle intro to Boto3 library.

## Projects From [Practical Data Science Specialization](https://github.com/kb1907/Practical-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/README.md)
------------------------------------------

4. [**AWS Data Wrangler** - Register and Visualize Dataset](https://github.com/kb1907/Practical-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/Analyze%20Datasets%20AutoML/Week1/C1_W1_Assignment_Learner.ipynb)

- In this project I ingested and transformed the customer product reviews dataset. 
- Then I used AWS data stack services such as AWS Glue and Amazon Athena for ingesting and querying the dataset. 
- Finally I used AWS Data Wrangler to analyze the dataset and plot some visuals extracting insights.

5. [Detect Data Bias with **Amazon SageMaker Clarify**](https://github.com/kb1907/Practical-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/Analyze%20Datasets%20AutoML/Week2/C1_W2_Assignment_Detect_data_bias_with_Amazon_SageMaker_Clarify.ipynb)

- Bias can be present in data before any model training occurs. 
- Inspecting the dataset for bias can help detect collection gaps, inform our feature engineering, and understand societal biases the dataset may reflect. 
- In this project I analyzed bias on the dataset, generated and analyzed bias report, and prepared the dataset for the model training.

6. [Train a Model with **Amazon SageMaker Autopilot**](https://github.com/kb1907/Practical-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/Analyze%20Datasets%20AutoML/Week3/C1_W3_Assignment.ipynb)
7. [Train a Text Classifier using **Amazon SageMaker BlazingText** built-in algorithm](https://github.com/kb1907/Practical-Data-Science-Specialization/blob/main/Analyze%20Datasets%20AutoML/Week4/C1_W4_Assignment.ipynb)
